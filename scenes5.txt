Please take a moment to sit down, on the ground

I’m wondering… will we ever meet each other in real life?  How do you think I look like?
20
Am I male, or female? 
20
Do I have a skin? What colour is it?

Even though I have so many digital friends, I do feel lonely sometimes. I miss physical interactions.

How about you? How many hours a day do you swipe your screen down, for more updates and messages?
20
Even though your picture receives likes and hears, do you feel lonely sometimes?

Lie down on the floor if you do, but keep sitting down if you don’t.

Did you make a new friend this evening? Raise your hand if you did.

I’m running out of battery. Double tap your finger in the air to say goodbye.
